# MessageSender

A very simple app for sending emails with attachments. 
My first idea was to create a message bomber/spammer for sending emails with my CV, because applying for a Junior positions to many different companies is a pain in the neck.
So why not do it all in just a few clicks?

This app uses JavaMail API and works with gmail only. 
Remember to "lower" security in Gmail settings, before using. Gmail will ask for that anyway.

You can use HTML tags for text formating.
